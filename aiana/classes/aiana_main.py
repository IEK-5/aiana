    """This is the core class, which is linking all other classes. It passes
    a settings objevt (for simulation, APV system, names and pathes - all
    grouped by util_classes.setings_grouper) to the other classes/objects
    fulfilling the following study steps:

    1. OctFileHandler to create/view octfiles
        (the oct-format is needed for Radiance simulations and contains the
        scene information about the geometries, materials and sky.
        The OctFileHandler takes besides the settings as input two
        util_classes-objects:
        - a weatherData-object containing the correct irradiance and sun
            position based on the time settings in sim_settings, and
        - a geometries_handler-object, which creates based on the apv_system
            settings rad-files (Radiance text file format for geometries)
    2. simulatorObj to simulate (tabular results creation), which needs
        - the settings for sim input and output file names and pathes,
        - the above mentioned geometries_handler-object for the scan positions
    3. evaluatorObj to evaluate(tabular results processing), which needs
        - the settings for file names and pathes,
        - the weatherData-object to update from outside, based on the time in
          the settings, the reference GHI for a fast (also in loops)
          shadow depth calculation
    4. plotterObj for plotting the results, which needs
        - the settings for file names and pathes, title, colormap unit, ...
        - the geometries_handler-object to (try to) avoid axis tick labels
          overlapping, buy taking scan area size and resolution into account
